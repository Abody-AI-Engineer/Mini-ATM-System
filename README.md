# 🏦 Mini-ATM System (Logic & Security)

This project is a functional Python simulation of an ATM interface, focusing on secure access and logical transaction management.

## 🛠️ Project Roadmap & Logic:

### 1. Security Phase (Authentication)
- Implements a secure login system requiring a **Username** and **PIN**.
- Validates user credentials against a stored database.

### 2. Service Menu
- Offers a clear interactive menu:
  - `1` Withdraw Funds.
  - `2` Deposit Funds.
  - `3` Exit System.

### 3. Core Logic & Calculations
- Manages an initial balance.
- Uses **f-strings** for clean and readable output of remaining balances.
- Performs real-time arithmetic for all transactions.

### 4. Validation (Edge Cases)
- Prevents withdrawals that exceed the current balance.
- Displays appropriate error messages: "Insufficient balance".

## 🚀 Skills Demonstrated:
- Python Control Flow (`if-elif-else`, `while` loops).
- Input Validation.
- Data Formatting (f-strings).
